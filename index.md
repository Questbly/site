## Why Questbly?
The [Questbly](https://app.questbly.com) app allows to quickly create and publish questionnaires online or in the real world.
The app is optimized for mobile browsing. The common flow is simple:
- sign up for Questbly;
- create your questionnaire and provide an email to collect responses;
- publish it;
- share by posting a direct link to your target audience or printing a QR code;
- get responses in your email.

## No data collection 
The app doesn't save a local copy of the collected data, it's all immediately emailed to the address you set up. 
You can set up access to the app with Google or Facebook, no personal data stored on the site in this case. 

## Open source
The source code of the Questbly app is available under Free BSD license.
